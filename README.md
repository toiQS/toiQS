## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am a final-year IT student at **Saigon University** and currently a **Backend Intern at VNPT Long An**, working with real production APIs.

My main interest is **backend system design** — how to structure applications so that business logic remains correct, maintainable, and resilient as complexity grows.

I prefer building **correct and long-lived systems** over feature-heavy demos, and I actively refactor designs when architectural limitations become clear.

## 📌 Featured Projects

### 🧠 TaskMind — Backend Architecture Case Study
**Tech:** .NET 8, EF Core, PostgreSQL, MediatR, CQRS  

TaskMind is a backend-focused project created to **rethink architectural decisions** made in earlier systems and to explore how backend designs can remain reliable as business complexity increases.

**Key focuses:**
- Clean Architecture with clear responsibility boundaries
- Domain-centric design (DDD-lite, non-dogmatic)
- Transactional consistency using EF Core and Unit of Work
- Domain Events to decouple side effects from core business logic
- Authentication implemented as a use case, not controller logic

This project prioritizes **architectural clarity and correctness** over feature breadth.

> Includes a small WPF UI as an exploratory MVVM experiment (not part of the core system).
